<p align=left><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>A&nbsp;code consisting of a group of printed and variously 
patterned bars and spaces and sometimes numerals that is designed to be scanned 
and read into computer memory as identification for the object it labels. Each 
of the digits zero through nine are represented by a different pattern of bars that can be 
read by a laser scanner. The bars are commonly found on consumer products 
and are used especially for inventory control. A barcode is a machine-readable symbol 
used to encode information in order to automate a business process. Examples of business processes 
are retail sales, shipping and tracking, inventory management, warehouse management, asset tracking, 
and automated data entry.</FONT>

through the use of barcodes. <BR>These barcodes are a form of coded information: all the 
data pertinent to the products are compressed within them. In other words, this 
coded information called barcodes have an equal value to the products 
themselves. we usualy get barcode in book as ISSN
