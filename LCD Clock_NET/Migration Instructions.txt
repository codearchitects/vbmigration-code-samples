Sample Name:  LCD Clock

Description:  A simple but intriguing application that displays a LCD clock.
              VB Migration Partner converts this sample flawlessly. We have 
	      used just one pragma to polish its user interface.

IMPORTANT NOTE
The first step to ensure that you can migrate the VB6 project to VB.NET is 
loading the original project in the Visual Basic 6 IDE, run it to ensure that 
it works fine, that all the required type libraries are installed, and that all 
file paths are correct. 
Regardless of whether you edited the source code in any way, you should save 
the VB6 project: this save operation ensures that the .vbp file includes  
the correct path and version of referenced type libraries. 
After saving the project, it's usually a good idea to compile the VB6 project
to an executable, to detect any VB6 compilation errors that would appear under 
VB.NET as well. 
(If you don't recompile the project VB Migration Partner will display a warning 
when you later load the project.)


This sample migrates correctly with no need for any pragma.

The VB6 app uses a checkbox without a Caption, which it obtains by using a small
value for the checkbox's Width property. However, we've have noticed that the VB.NET
checkbox control automatically wraps the caption when the Width is smaller than about
17 pixels, therefore the first letter of the caption is displayed anyway. You can 
avoid this minor defect by inserting the following pragma at the top of ClockAbout.frm 
file: 

    '## Check1.WriteProperty Caption, ""
