Sample Name: Spell Checker

Description: An interesting tiny application that does spell checking, and does 
             it very well. It comes with a database of over 450,000 words and 

             uses Soundex and Levenshtein distance to find all the words that 

             have a pronunciation “close” to a word your type. VB Migration 

             Partner converts this program to VB.NET without having to edit the 

             original code in any way.

IMPORTANT NOTE
The first step to ensure that you can migrate the VB6 project to VB.NET is 
loading the original project in the Visual Basic 6 IDE, run it to ensure that 
it works fine, that all the required type libraries are installed, and that all 
file paths are correct. 
Regardless of whether you edited the source code in any way, you should save 
the VB6 project: this save operation ensures that the .vbp file includes  
the correct path and version of referenced type libraries. 
After saving the project, it's usually a good idea to compile the VB6 project
to an executable, to detect any VB6 compilation errors that would appear under 
VB.NET as well. 
(If you don't recompile the project VB Migration Partner will display a warning 
when you later load the project.)


This sample can be converted to VB.NET as-is, without editing the original source 
code. However, you might want to add the following pragmas at the top of the 
frmSpellCheck form, so that the two data files are automatically included in the 
converted project:

	'## AddDataFile wl.txt
	'## AddDataFile words.mdb

NOTE: Before migrating this sample, remember to replace the mdb file in the root 
      directory with the empty one located in "DB's" folder in order to create 
      words DB using migrated app.
