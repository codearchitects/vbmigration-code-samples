Title: Grid-Net Waves 3D animation
Description: Hi-Lo algorithm . I found somewhere this algorithm , and made this demo , simulating waves with Grid ( net ) . It looks interesting and it is possible to make various models of 3D grid-waves , depends on math function you choose. I've added simulation of animated 3D grid-wave , just to make it more effective. It is nice graphical performance , and with possibility to make a lot of extensions in this field of programming. However , it is not so easy to understand , but I hope that it could be useful. See the screenshot . I would like to see your comments about , and votes :) Enjoy ! !
