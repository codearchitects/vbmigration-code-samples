Sample Name: Grid-Net Waves 3D

Description: It’s a nice code sample that creates a 3D graph and then animates 
             it. It doesn’t do much useful, other than providing a great example 
             of animation techniques (as well as a great example of VB Migration 
             Partner’s conversion abilities!).

IMPORTANT NOTE
The first step to ensure that you can migrate the VB6 project to VB.NET is 
loading the original project in the Visual Basic 6 IDE, run it to ensure that 
it works fine, that all the required type libraries are installed, and that all 
file paths are correct. 
Regardless of whether you edited the source code in any way, you should save 
the VB6 project: this save operation ensures that the .vbp file includes  
the correct path and version of referenced type libraries. 
After saving the project, it's usually a good idea to compile the VB6 project
to an executable, to detect any VB6 compilation errors that would appear under 
VB.NET as well. 
(If you don't recompile the project VB Migration Partner will display a warning 
when you later load the project.)


This sample migrates nicely to VB.NET after you add the following two project-
level pragmas at the top of frmWaves.frm file

	'## project:ArrayBounds ForceZero
	'## project:UseByVal Yes
