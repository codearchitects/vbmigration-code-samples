Title: A Complete Web Browser
Description: A complete Web browser with most of the basic functions included like copy, page properties, print, view source, back and forward subitems, progress bar, autocomplete feature, etc. I sorta copy the Internet Explorer's GUI turns out just fine. With some minor improvement, it'll be of good use to some.
Use this if you're getting bored with Internet Explorer. I have some bugs though, just debug it. LOL. Have fun!!!
