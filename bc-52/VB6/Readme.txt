 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ATOMIX cipher machine is an advanced virtual Cold War era
 electro-mechanical rotor machine, situated between the Enigma
 cipher machine and the Fialka M-125.

 With its eight irregular stepping rotors, moving in both directions,
 the ATOMIX has a far better cryptographic strength as the Enigma
 and a tremendous key space. Its flexible pin settings provide many
 more different rotor movements than the Fialka. This very realistic
 virtual ATOMIX enables you to encipher and decipher messages, and
 apply the key settings as you would with an actual machine.
