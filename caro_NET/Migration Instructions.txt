Description: A board game similar to Go game. It demonstrates that VB Migration 
             Partner converts graphic primitives, handles arrays with nonzero 
             lower bound, and correctly deals with Variant variables and late 
             binding.

IMPORTANT NOTE
The first step to ensure that you can migrate the VB6 project to VB.NET is 
loading the original project in the Visual Basic 6 IDE, run it to ensure that 
it works fine, that all the required type libraries are installed, and that all 
file paths are correct. 
Regardless of whether you edited the source code in any way, you should save 
the VB6 project: this save operation ensures that the .vbp file includes  
the correct path and version of referenced type libraries. 
After saving the project, it's usually a good idea to compile the VB6 project
to an executable, to detect any VB6 compilation errors that would appear under 
VB.NET as well. 
(If you don't recompile the project VB Migration Partner will display a warning 
when you later load the project.)


The sample neeeds a project-level pragma for handling non-zero lower bounded arrays.
You can add the pragma at the top of the Form1 code, as follow:

'## project:ArrayBounds ForceZero

VB Migration Partner will change the arrays lower bound to zero without 
modifing the upper bound. This is the best strategy when your code 
processes the arrays using a loop such as this:

For i = 1 To n
    For j = 1 To n
        bang(i, j) = 1
    Next
Next


VB Migration Partner typically delivers many warnings that are related to 
code analysis as well as suggestions about how you can improve the original 
VB6 code before converting it to VB.NET. 
You can suppress these warnings by adding the following project-level pragmas 
at the top of any of the file that make up the project:

'## project:DisableMessage 0354
