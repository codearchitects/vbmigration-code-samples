Title: Expression Evaluator (that is - STRING CALCULATOR)
Description: Ever wanted to have a program, that will calculate the value of a given expression? (like you give it "2*3^sin(2)+23/(2*Abs(-8.5)" and it returns the value). Well HERE IT IS - My 'EVALUATOR' class. You may search all over, noone will give you such source (at least I didn't find). :) ('Eat MY code...':)
---Also, read the README.TXT File in the Zip. Thanx!
