------------------------------------------------------
You may use this code for free if you give me credit.
If you modify it or make your own program with it,
I would VERY APPRECIATE, if you mail me it (or better-a link to it)

On the whole - just do not stamp your name on what you haven't
done quite alone.
------------------------------------------------------
Well, the 'Diamond' of the whole thing is, of course, the
'Evaluator' class.
It was written totally by me, and 'it took me about
2 days to code it (and about a year
-that is,from the very moment I got interested in programming-
I spent dreaming of having such a thing)

(BTW this code seems to be quite unique-
I searched all over the Internet for such, but NOONE
is giving the source for such things (in fact, I even
didn't any equivalent without the source :))
------------------------------------------------------
This project was my last one in VB :(, 'cause I switched
to Delphi :) later (the date is 24.6.1999).
I rewrote it in Delphi and I found
quite a lot of 'undocumented features' (bugs :) in it and many 
ways to improve it.
I must confess, I was too lazy to correct this old file,
because these bugs are not very BIG and quite easy to remove.
Anyway, this code seems unique and excellent (I'm proud of me ;)

Maybe you will be interested in how you can improve it?
Well, you can: 
1) Improve this stupid syntax error checking!
2) Add more functions
3) Make support for string functions (like MsgBox:) and for functions 
with different number of arguments.
4) Make support for variables and constants
  (I mean there must be some Sub like 'SetVariable(VarName as String,Value as Double)' 
5) Many more..

All these improvements will take you about several
 hours, (I know, I did) and here use your imagination:
  for example: create your own script language :)
 
6) BTW I've recently found a way of making this stuff shorter
  and more beautiful and faster, maybe, if I finish it, I'll post it to 
  Planet-Source-Code (well, if I will not be lazy enough to ReMake it in VB:).
