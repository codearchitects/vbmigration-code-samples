VB MP3 Player 0.1.7

Information:

VB MP3 Player is a simple media player, and it should play MP3, WAVE and MIDI files.

The source code is quite messy, and not all of the remarks are in English yet.
I'm working now on translating the change log and the source to English, but it may take a long time until I'll finish that task.
The VB Runtime 6.0 files are required for running the player.

The file 'modShapedForm.bas' was created with TracEr (a program made by Richard Leitao, it's free and can be downloaded from- http://www.vbside.com/programPg.asp?pid=6&DetailID=1)

What's new:

* In the open dialog, the multi-select is allowed.

* The menu can be also opened from the playlist window.

* WAVE files are now supported.

* Now it's possible to open MP3 files with the command line.

* New tooltip for the timer that shows the file length.

* New tooltip for the playlist that shows the full name of the selected file.
