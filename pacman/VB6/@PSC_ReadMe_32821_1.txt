Title: Enhanced Pacman
Description: This is a pacman game I wrote which took 3 days to write, about 15 hours all up.
It follows the original pacman game as close as I could and has two modes, original and enhanced, enhanced being just more prettier graphics.
As I didn't use any directX, people with slower computers might find the game runs a little slow, though I'm not sure about this. :)
If your computer is fairly slow and it misses frames then you could change the tmrkeyboard to 20 milliseconds and play it on turbo speed (x2 normal speed). :)
