Sample Name: SQLServerDocumenter

Description: A quite useful utility that uses the SQLDMO type library to let 
             you find all the SQL Servers on the network, explore their tables 
             and indexes, export the result to Microsoft Excel, etc. The VB.NET 
             version compiles and runs correctly at the first attempt, without 
             the need of one single pragma!

IMPORTANT NOTE
The first step to ensure that you can migrate the VB6 project to VB.NET is 
loading the original project in the Visual Basic 6 IDE, run it to ensure that 
it works fine, that all the required type libraries are installed, and that all 
file paths are correct. 
Regardless of whether you edited the source code in any way, you should save 
the VB6 project: this save operation ensures that the .vbp file includes  
the correct path and version of referenced type libraries. 
After saving the project, it's usually a good idea to compile the VB6 project
to an executable, to detect any VB6 compilation errors that would appear under 
VB.NET as well. 
(If you don't recompile the project VB Migration Partner will display a warning 
when you later load the project.)


VB Migration Partner converts this sample with no need of any rilevant pragma.


VB Migration Partner typically delivers many warnings that are related to 
code analysis as well as suggestions about how you can improve the original 
VB6 code before converting it to VB.NET. 
You can suppress these warnings by adding the following project-level pragmas 
at the top of any of the file that make up the project:

'##project:DisableMessage 0501
'##project:DisableMessage 0551
'##project:DisableMessage 0561
'##project:DisableMessage 0181
