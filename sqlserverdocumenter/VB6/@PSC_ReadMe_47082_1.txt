Title: SQL Server Documenter
Description: SQL Server Documenter can display, print and export to Excel a complete overview of all fields and indexes in a table. This started as a "hello world" type of thing for SQL-DMO and this is the result. It's great for debugging or documenting your databases (that's why I wrote it ;-)). Try it and any suggestions are always welcome.
